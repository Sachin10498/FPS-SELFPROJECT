# FPS-SELFPROJECT
This program expects the console dimensions to be set to 
	120 Columns by 40 Rows. I recommend a small font "Consolas" at size 16. You can do this
	by running the program, and right clicking on the console title bar, and specifying 
	the properties. You can also choose to default to them in the future.
	
	Controls: A = Turn Left, D = Turn Right, W = Walk Forwards, S = Walk Backwards
	Future Modifications
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	1) Shade block segments based on angle from player, i.e. less light reflected off
	walls at side of player. Walls straight on are brightest.
	2) Find an interesting and optimised ray-tracing method. I'm sure one must exist
	to more optimally search the map space
	3) Add bullets!
	4) Add bad guys!
